PENETRAION TESTING :-



Information Gathering - (Gathering data from our target)

*Active information Gathering  - (Gathering data from our target by interacting with them directly)
*Passive information Gathering - (Gathering data of our target from a middle source)

In company website, we collect emails,ip addresses,networks,information of what software and language they are using.
Then , there are some machine which are outdated , where we search for vulnerablities

nslookup #domain (to find ip)
whois #domain (to find ip)

'STEALTHY SCAN'
whatweb --help (to get help-info about whatweb)
whatweb #domain (will scan a website and give details)
--no-errors (hide errors)
whatweb #iprange #aggression 

Example : whatweb  192.28.1.1-192.28.1.255 --aggression 3 -v --no-errors --log-verbose=#txtfilename (-v is used to give details in format,and --log-verbose is used to save the report in a textfile)

theHarvester --help (to get help-info about theHarvester)
theHarvester -d #domain -b #source (-d is to mention domain , -b is to mention source such as google,linkedin etc. or else you can just put -b all)

SCANNING :-

There are virtual open ports in machines .
port 80 is used for HTTP
port 443 is used for HTTPS
(HTTPS is just a secure version of HTTP)


Communication Protocols :

TCP - Transmission Control Protocol (will resend the packets if packets didn't received .This will confirm whether the packets are received as well as the packets will be received without any errors)

UDP -  User Datagram Protocol (this will just send packets and will not ensure whether client received or not. As well as this will not resend the packets again. This is Faster)


sudo netdiscover - (used to capture arp packets from our network.This will show the IP, Mac address and hostname of connected machines in our network) 

netstat -nr (will show the ip address my network , which is mentioned under Gateway)

nmap #ipaddress (will show the open ports and its services)
nmap 192.168.29.1-255 (will find ports and details from range of ip addresses)

nmap -sS #ipaddress (-sS means SynScan )
nmap -sT #ipaddress (-sT means TcpconnectScan)
nmap -sU #ipaddress (-sU means UdpScan)
nmap -sn #ipaddress (this will send icmp ping requests to check whether the host is up)

//zenmap is the GUI of nmap

map -T4 -F 192.168.29.0/24  (-T is for fast execution & -F is for Few ports)


ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*smb* (this command is used to search for a particular files)

--badsum :- this is used to generate in invalid checksum for packets. Any real TCP/IP stack would drop this packet, however, firewalls may potentially respond automatically, without bothering to check the checksum of the packet. As such, this switch can be used to determine the presence of a firewall/IDS.
